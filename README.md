# Exploratory Data Analysis

Graphical and Quantitative Exploratory Data Analysis for several projects. The output is in Jupyter Notebook format.

Project 1 ('eda_hosp_read.pynb'): 

This project explored the relationship between variables in Hospital Readmissions dataset using Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy (stats). In this exercise, I identified which variables are correlated with hospital readmissions. After determining which variables were related, I performed a hypothesis test and created a regression plot to determine if the relationship was statistically significant. 

Project 2 ('eda_rac_dsic.ipynb'):

Using a US labor market dataset, I examined the effect of race on callbacks for interviews. To test the null hypothesis, the proportion of African-American was the same as the proprotion of callbacks for caucasians, I created a bootstrapped version of the dataset using permutation. I then performed a z test and a Frequentist approach to compare evaluate the proportions of the these two subpopulations.


Project 3 ('eda_temp.ipynb')

I performed graphical exploratory data analysis on a dataset of human body temperature. I used seaborn, statsmodels and numpy to determine body temperature's distribution, the true population mean and relationship to gender.
